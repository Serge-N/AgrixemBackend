# Description
In Africa record keeping and livestock management has always been a challenge. To solve this the school requested
for software to help small scale farmers keep their records and manage there livestock. 
This has many benefits which may not be discussed here.

Request a report from the school if you are interested. 

It is important to stress that this application is a **Minimum Viable Product**, to use this in production would require
